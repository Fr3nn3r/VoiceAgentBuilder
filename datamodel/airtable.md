# Airtable MVP Schema Summary

This document summarizes the three connected tables in your Airtable base for Dr. Fillionâ€™s assistant (Camille/Ava voice agents). The goal is to let developers understand the schema, relationships, and automation integration points.

## ðŸ”— Integration Overview (Automation Layer)

**Inbound (AI Agent â†’ n8n â†’ Airtable):**

* n8n webhook receives JSON from the voice agent with: transcript, recording link, appointment info, sentiment.
* n8n upserts:

  * **Conversation** record with transcript + audio URL.
  * **Appointment** record (new or existing).
  * **Patient** record (if missing).

**Outbound (Airtable â†’ Doctor):**

* Dr Fillion reviews conversations directly in Airtable (audio playback + summary).
* Optional: daily digest email (via n8n) of new or updated calls.

---

### ðŸª¶ Summary for Developers

* **3 linked tables:** `Patients`, `Appointments`, `Conversations`.
* **Relationships:** Patient â†” Appointment â†” Conversation (1-to-many / many-to-1).
* **Automation:** n8n webhook receives JSON, writes to Airtable via API.
* **AI fields:** Summary & Sentiment are post-processed (OpenAI or Airtable AI).
* **UX goal:** Dr Fillion can read, search, and listen to calls inside Airtable â€” no custom frontend required.
